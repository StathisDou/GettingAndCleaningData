# Getting And Cleaning Data

This repository was created for the peer-graded assignment of:
Getting And Cleaning Data, from Data Science Specialization, by Johns Hopkins University, on coursera

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The data for the project are downloaded from the following URL : (by running the function run_analysis)

 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

The guidelines were to create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
    of each variable for each activity and each subject.
